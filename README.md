# Introduction
An attempt at creating extension modules using nvcc cuda compiler.
Most of the idea is inspired from npcuda-example [here](https://github.com/rmcgibbo/npcuda-example).
But instead of doing runtime hot-patches to the compiler object, this goes via
the OO way, in the hope of keeping things cleaner.

# Installation
```bash
python setup.py install
```
'pip install' coming soon!

# Usage
Refer [here](https://teju85.github.io/blog/2018/03/14/cudistutils.html)

# License
Same as https://github.com/rmcgibbo/npcuda-example/blob/master/LICENSE.
Because this is inspired from the above project.
